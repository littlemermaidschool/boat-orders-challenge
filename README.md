# A plaice for orders

## Requirements

- [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](Node 12.\*) & the npm version that comes bundled with it (6.\_)
- [https://code.visualstudio.com/](VSCode) with the liveshare extension would be nice, but we can accommodate whichever editor you feel most comfortable in

## The Task

Pretend that you have been given the task of extending the handler in an
unspecified way. You're confident that the code is working, but maybe whoever
wrote it didn't have time to make it as nice as we might like. You decide to
make it better before getting on with the feature.

Pretend that the db is used by other features, and bear this in mind if you wish
to change any behaviour.

Try to talk through your thought process with the team as you go about improving
what you see. We're as interested in your thinking as the code you write.

We value correct, testable, simple, expressive code, and hope that you can refactor
boat order creation with this in mind.

This is meant to be a fun exercise using a real piece of code that we iterated upon,
there are not meant to be any tricks.
